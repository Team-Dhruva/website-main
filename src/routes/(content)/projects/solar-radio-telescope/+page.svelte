      To monitor and analyze the dynamic activities within the Sun's
      chromosphere, including the solar cycle.

      To design and assemble a radio telescope that is small-scale and
      affordable.

    <p>
      We built a small-scale radio telescope to observe the Sun's chromosphere,
      using a TV satellite dish as the primary reflector. The telescope is
      equipped with a low-noise amplifier and a software-defined radio receiver
      to capture radio signals from the Sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      We conduct observations of the Sun and perform analysis on the data
      collected. Observations are carried out on a regular basis to study the
      solar cycle.
