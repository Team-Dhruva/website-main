      Astrophotography stands as a testament to the beauty of the universe. It
      is the art of capturing the night sky in all its glory. We at dhRuVa
      develop the technical skills and knowledge required to capture the
      universe in all its glory.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our main setup involves a Raspberry Pi and a camera module. We use the
      Raspberry Pi to control the camera module and capture images of the night
      sky. We then process these images to bring out the beauty of the universe.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every so often, skywatching sessions are conducted where we set up our
      equipment and capture images of the night sky.
