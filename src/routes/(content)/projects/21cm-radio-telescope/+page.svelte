      To observe the galaxy in the 1420 MHz frequency and map the galaxy with
      respect to velocities, ultimately plot the rotation curve for our Milky
      Way Galaxy.

      To build a Horn Antenna from scratch and assemble the electronic
      components to build a H21 cm line Radio Telescope.

      The 21 cm line is a spectral line of neutral hydrogen, which is the most
      abundant element in the universe. The 21 cm line is a hyperfine structure
      line of neutral hydrogen.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a very important line in radio astronomy because it is the only line
      that can be detected in the interstellar medium. The 21 cm line is used to
      study the distribution of neutral hydrogen in the galaxy and can be used
      to study the rotation curve of the galaxy.
