    Dhruva is the astrophysics club at RV College of engineering that
    comprises an interdisciplinary team working towards understanding our
    universe better. What began as a quest to explore the secrets of the
    universe is now a growing team of amateur astrophysics enthusiasts. Like
    dhruva, the pole star, we at dhruva also constantly try to keep up with
    the happenings of the universe and events affecting earth through our
    telescopes, radio telescopes and analysis.
  </p>
  <p>
    We host stargazing events, astrophysics-related coding competitions and
    engage in impactful discussions on latest observations made by the
    astrophysics community across the globe. We also believe in sharing our
    understanding with fellow astrophysics enthusiasts through our informative
    videos, blogs and journals.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have also delved into astrophotography for capturing the marvelous
    pictures of the universe! We collaborate with ABBA and other
    student astrophysics clubs for organizing interactive sessions and better
    outreach.
  </p>
  <p>We at dhruva try to make astrophysics fun for us and everyone around!</p>
